\section{The logarithm and inverse functions}

Branches.
\subsection{Inverse \(\sin\) functions}

$w=\sin^{-1}(z)$ then $z=sin(w)=\frac{e^{iw}-e^{-iw}}{2i}$ from which 

\subsection{Inverse Hyperbolic functions}
\[z=\frac{e^{w}-e^{-w}}{e^{w}+e^{-w}}.\] from which 
\[e^{2w} =  \] 
Solve for $e^{w}$ and take $\ln$ .

Note that $\ln(x)$ has infinite many branches while $\sqrt[5]{x}$ only has 5 branches.
